## Mission 
  
Christmas time is usually a time for gatherings, festivities, and joyfulness 
  
  But, every year thousands of familes in need go without the means to spend a cheerful Chirstmas.
  
  Fortunately toydrives have been wildly successful thanks to the charitable acts of strangers.
  
  Each family has a specific need but sometimes do not get those items fulfilled.
  
  Thanks to our new app, Gift, families can sign up on our site and make a list of what they need this year, be it food, clothing, or toys.
  
  Individuals who are connected with local charities simply enter a username and an access code to create a new account. So, you'd enter your name and your address at the top.  Your address will only be visible to us so you remain anonymous.  Next, add some items to your wish list.  Finally, submit your list.
  
  Wonderful doners can access credentials from their local charitable organization and then log into the site, see what was on the Smith's list this year, and check off items that they pledge to donate.
  
  The holiday are a poignant time of year. It's when the most people are thinking of gift giving, and the time of year when families in need could use gifts the most.
